                    <p>Inspired by the Greek top 100 songs I was curious to see what songs the world was
                        listening to, so I decided to scrape <a class="portfolio__item__link" href='https://charts.spotify.com/home'>Spotify Charts</a>.

                        Beautiful Soup and create a data model in a sqlite database with the results. The database was
                        then connected to PowerBI </p>
